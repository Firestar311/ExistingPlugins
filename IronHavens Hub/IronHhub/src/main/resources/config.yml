Version: 1.0.2


# Plugin made by AloneMusk for IronHavens.

# Iron Havens Hub, this plugin controls the Hub of IronHavens Skyblock.
# I added some options for configuration instead of uploading the plugin again because it is hard coded.


# Options
base_command: "IH"
base_permission: "ironhavens"


# Spawncoords
spawnworld: "spawn"
x: 5
y: 64.0
z: -1000
yaw: 90
pitch: 0

#MOTD
#%line% = goes onto the second line | So when you put %line% it moves the rest of the MOTD behind it to the next line of the MOTD.

MOTD: "              &6[IronHavens] %line% &6Join now for stuff"
